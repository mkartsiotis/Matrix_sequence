This is a series of mathematical simulations attempting to visualize and solve(by brute-force)the following problem:
Suppose we have 10 single digit numbers. We put one next to the other creating a sequence of 10 numbers.
Next we create another sequence of 10 single-digit numbers(or one 10 digit number)that in each place has the number of 0s, 1s, 2s,...9s
So the sequence: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 9 produces\n
                 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 and then
                 1 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 and then
                 7 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 and
                 7 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 and finally
                 7 2 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 which is circular
The theorem that we will proove this way and later analytically(easily)is that all numbers converge to 0 or two 3 distinct combinations.
Enjoy!
